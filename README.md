# Simple Binder demo

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ageorgou/binder_sample_repo/master)

This is a very simple repository to try out Binder. It does some
visualisation of random data using Holoviews.

To try it out, open and run the Visualisation notebook. Check that
the loaded data has the expected values (see the end of the notebook),
to make sure the Binder is created correctly!
